# CodeScript Toolkit

(formerly known as `Fix Require Modules`, see [Rebranding](#rebranding) section for more details)

This is a plugin for [`Obsidian`][Obsidian] that allows to do a lot of things with [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] scripts from inside the [`Obsidian`][Obsidian] itself.

## Who is this plugin for?

This plugin is for you if you want to:

- Write in any flavor of [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] in:
  - [`DevTools Console`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console) within [`Obsidian`][Obsidian];
  - [`CustomJS`](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js) scripts;
  - [`datacorejs` / `datacorejsx` / `datacorets` / `datacoretsx`](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/datacore/code-views) scripts;
  - [`dataviewjs`](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) scripts;
  - [`JS Engine`](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-js-engine-plugin-docs/) scripts;
  - [`Modules`](https://github.com/polyipseity/obsidian-modules) scripts;
  - [`QuickAdd`](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/) scripts;
  - [`Templater`](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) scripts;
  - etc.
- Write modular scripts using modern [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] syntax and patterns.
- Prototype [`Obsidian`][Obsidian] plugins.
- Explore [`Obsidian`][Obsidian] API (public and internal) in runtime easier.
- Invoke any [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] script via command or hotkey.

## Why this plugin?

There are several very good plugins that allow to write [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] scripts for [`Obsidian`][Obsidian], but they all have their own limitations and quirks.

Most of those plugins support writing scripts in [`CommonJS` (`cjs`)](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules) only, which is not so used nowadays.

None of those plugins provide you the developer experience as you would have in any other modern [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] development environment.

This plugin aims to erase the line between the [`Obsidian`][Obsidian] world and the [`JavaScript`][JavaScript]/[`TypeScript`][TypeScript] development world.

## Rebranding

This plugin was formerly known as `Fix Require Modules`.

The plugin quickly overgrew its original purpose and got way more features than just fixing [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#requireid) calls. That's why it got a new name.

However, for the backward compatibility, the previous id `fix-require-modules` is still used internally and you might find it

- in plugin folder name;
- in plugin URL;
- in [Debugging](#debugging) section;
